Zombie Game Rogue Like


I'm starting a zombie based roguelike.  You will start in a small city and have to fight through the zombie hordes to reach an extraction point.  This is my first roguelike.

My initial plans include:
1) a randomly generated city
2) common weapons and items for salvage
3) zombies that wander around the town, and can hear noise over a distance
4) the world starts off with civilians in it, which quickly get eaten.

My tools:
1) Groovy and Java7
2) SquidLib
3) Intellij
